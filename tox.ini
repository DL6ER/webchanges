# tox.ini file for Tox https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html

# To perform the same tests done in GitHub Actions by CI-CD but locally (i.e. before pushing), run $ tox --parallel

# At its core tox provides a convenient way to run arbitrary commands in isolated environments to serve as a single
# entry point for build, test and release activities.

# May be run in parallel:
# > tox -p  # TODO: this can be unreliable

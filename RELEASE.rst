Notice
------
Support for Python 3.8 will be removed on or about 5 October 2023. A reminder that older Python versions are
supported for 3 years after being obsoleted by a new major release (i.e. about 4 years since their original release).

Internals
---------
* Upgraded build environment to ``build`` using ``pyproject.toml``, eliminating ``setup.py``.
* Migrated to ``pyproject.toml`` configuration of all tools that can read it.

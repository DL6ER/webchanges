Added
-------------------
* Multiple job files or glob patterns can now be specified by repeating the ``--jobs`` argument.
* Job list filtering using `Python regular expression
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__. Example: ``--list blue`` lists jobs with
  'blue' in their name (case-sensitive), while ``--list (?i)blue`` is `case-insensitive
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.I>`__.
* New URL job directive ``params`` for specifying URL parameters (query strings), e.g. as a dictionary.
* New ``gotify`` reporter (upstream contribution: `link <https://github.com/thp/urlwatch/pull/823/files>`__).
* Improved messaging when a legacy database that requires conversion is found at startup.

Changed
-------------------
* Updated ``ai_google`` differ to reflect Gemini 1.5 Pro's 2M token context window.

Fixed
-------------------
* Corrected the handling of data with a 'text/markdown' MIME type in differs and reporters.
* ``wdiff`` differ improvements:
  - Fixed body font issues;
  - Removed spurious ``^\n`` insertions in the report;
  - Corrected ``range_info`` lines;
  - Added word break opportunities (``<wbr>``) in HTML output for better browser handling of long lines.
* ``deepdiff`` differ now reports individual elements when the data added or removed is a list.
* Improved URL matching for jobs by normalizing %xx escapes and plus signs (e.g. ``https://www.example.org/El Ni√±o``
  will now match ``https://www.example.org/El+Ni%C3%B1o`` and vice versa).
* Improved URL linkifier to accurately extract URLs with multiple parameters from text.

Internals
-------------------
* Replaced ``requests.structures.CaseInsensitiveDict`` with ``httpx.Headers`` as the Class holding headers.
* ``Job.headers`` attribute now initialized with an empty ``httpx.Headers`` object instead of None.

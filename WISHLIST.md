- [ ] Smart "just works for the web" philosophy automatically applies correct filters for monitoring webpages
- [ ] Switch to `defusedxml` if possible to prevent XML attacks 
- [ ] Add more tests
  - [ ] Increase line coverage
- [ ] Document code
  - [ ] Docstrings
  - [ ] Make autodoc work
- [ ] Database grows to infinity! (and it's not even documented!)
- [ ] Update database only if all reporters run successfully without errors
  - [ ] Or queue failed (undelivered) reports?
- [ ] Improve handling of terminated execution (related)
  - [ ] If the retrieved data were only saved to the database after it was output, this way of missing diffs would 
        be prevented
  - [ ] Provide a convenient way to show past diffs that might have been missed due to exceptions or user error
- [ ] Figure out what to do with `--add JOB` and `--delete JOB`
